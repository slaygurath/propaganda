# Circular Letter to the Several Colonies

**From the Sons of Liberty in Massachusetts**

*March 5, 1770*

Brethren,

We address you at a time of grave peril to our liberties. The recent imposition of the Townshend Acts by the British Parliament represents an unfortunate imposition upon the free inhabitants of these colonies. These duties on tea, glass, lead, paper, and paints are not merely a revenue measure, but a deliberate assault on our right to be taxed only by our own elected representatives.

We hold that the Townshend Acts are unconstitutional, for they violate the ancient principle that no Englishman may be taxed without his consent, given through his own legislature. Parliament, in which we have no voice, has assumed a power to levy taxes upon us for the sole purpose of raising revenue—a power never granted by our charters and directly contrary to the spirit of the British constitution.

We therefore call upon every colony to join us in unified resistance. Let us stand together in defense of our rights as freeborn English subjects. Let no colony act alone, for divided we are weak, but united we are strong.

Let us communicate our grievances to His Majesty and to Parliament, and let us pursue every peaceful means to secure the repeal of these oppressive acts.

In the cause of liberty,

*The Sons of Liberty*
